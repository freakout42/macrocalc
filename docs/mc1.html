MacroCALC v10.52. Interactive spreadsheet calculator.
<BR>
On Systems where <B>mc</B> is used by other programs,
<B>321</B> can be used as an alias for <B>mc</B>.
<B>321</B> means 321 is more than 123.

<B>mc</B> [<I>-option...</I>] [<I>file</I>]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Description_</H2>
<B>mc</B>
is an interactive, macro-programmable spreadsheet calculator.
<B>mc</B>
has no graphic features, but therefore it can run also on terminals.
It uses a convenient,
well-known user interface and has some special features especially
interesting in the
<B>UNIX</B>
environment.
It is the only spreadsheet that can handle units in calculations -
so 1m + 1km = 1001m.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options_</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-l<DD>
Sets alternative screen layout with input line at the bottom.
<DT>-b<DD>
Suppress displaying the borders with column and row numbering.
<DT>-s<DD>
Suppress displaying current cell in line 1 of the screen.
This is especially interesting on slow terminals,
since moving around is much faster.
<DT>-m<DD>
Suppress displaying the menu, marked range and the recalculation message
for slow terminal lines.
<DT>-h<DD>
Suppress highlighting of the marked range for slow terminal lines.
<DT>-e<DD>
Combination of -bmsl options for a complete clean screen with only data displayed.
<DT>-k<DD>
Suppress using colors even when the terminal is capable of.
<DT>-cg<DD>
Marked range is full spreadsheet after load.
<DT>-cw<DD>
Sets preset column width to <B>w</B>. Default is 11.
<DT>-dp<DD>
Sets preset decimal places to <B>p</B>. Default is 2.
<DT>-fF<DD>
Sets preset format to <B>F</B>. Default is General.

<DT>-yc<DD>
Sets currency symbol to <B>c</B>. Default is dollar (<B>$</B>).
<DT>-a<DD>
No autocalc mode.
<DT>-r<DD>
Read-only mode.
Worksheets cannot be saved.
This is useful, when output is done by &quot;cell&gt;command&quot; statements.
See shell-script
<B>mcrdb</B>
for an example.
<DT>-omacrofile<DD>
Auto-execute macro found in <B>macrofile</B> after loading the worksheet.
This option also suppresses the interactive startup message.
The <B>macrofile</B> &quot;-&quot; only suppresses the interactive startup message.
<DT>-nmacrocommands<DD>
Auto-execute macros in <B>macrocommands</B> after loading the worksheet.
This option also suppresses the interactive startup message.
<DT>-x<DD>
Sets command autoexec mode.
All
cell-commands
&quot;cell&lt;command&quot; found in a new loaded worksheet and
&quot;cell&gt;command&quot; found in a saved worksheet
will be executed automatically.
<DT>-u<DD>
Starts
<B>$ARX/mcunits</B>
as a background process for
unit conversion
calculation.
The &quot;units&quot; function of
<B>mc</B>
can only work with this option!
Startup is slower with this option,
so only use it if unit conversion is needed.
<DT>-p<DD>
Pipes the standard input (a worksheet file) into the standard
output (<B>[nt]roff</B> source format) without interactive action.
This <B>must</B> be the last option when present!
This is especially interesting because
<B>mc</B>
uses a fully transparent, editable
ASCII file format,
which is compatible with the
<B>/rdb</B>
database system.
The worksheet file can easily be edited or manipulated with almost any UNIX
command such as
<B>sed</B>
or <B>awk</B>.
You can also use <B>/rdb</B>'s
100-plus powerful database commands.
<DT>-q<DD>
Pipes the standard input (a worksheet file) into a
&quot;comma-separated-values&quot; file
without interactive action.
This <B>must</B> be the last option when present!
<DT>-v<DD>
Prints version information.
Options are also taken from the environment variable &quot;MACROCALC&quot;.

<H2>General Overview_</H2>
A worksheet is a table built from columns and rows.
Every point of intersection between a column and a row is called a cell.
A cell can be filled with text, constant values or formulas.
<P>
<B>mc</B>
supports:
<P>
- 702 columns named A..Z and AA..ZZ
<P>
- 99999 rows named 1..99999.
<P>
Every cell has a unique cell address with column and row name ranging from
A1..ZZ99999.
<P>
Since a monitor can only display 24 rows and 80 characters at any given time,
only a small
part of the worksheet is displayed.
One cell, the
<I>current cell,</I>
is highlighted and its contents is displayed in line 1 of the screen
(unless
option <I>-s</I>
was given at startup).
Movement around
through the worksheet is possible with the cursor keys.
Line 2 of the screen is the edit line where cell input is displayed.
Line 3 is the status and message line where information is displayed.
The rest of the screen shows the worksheet.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>File format_</H2>
<B>mc</B>
uses a fully transparent and easy-to-understand file format to store worksheets.
It is organized like a table and is compatible with
<B>/rdb</B>
table database format.
The columns of the table are separated with <B>&lt;tab&gt;</B>,
the rows with <B>&lt;newline&gt;</B>.
At the top of each column is a column name and a dashed row to separate the 
names from the data.
The columns are:

Files produced by 
<B>mc</B>
V1.x must be transformed by the utility
<B>mc2conv</B>
with the command:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
mc2conv <I>&lt;mc1file &gt;mc2file</I>
</PRE>
</DL>
This command transforms the old file into a form that can be read by
<B>mc</B>
V2.x and its successors.
It is also a example of processing an 
<B>mc</B>
file with <B>awk</B>.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Recalculation_</H2>
To save memory, formulas are stored as text without any additional
parsing information: therefore recalculation is slow.
For large worksheets, autocalc mode should be turned off by using
the menu command
<I>/Worksheet Autocalc</I>
or the
option <I>-a</I>.
Manual recalculation is started with
<I>[Recalc]</I>
after finishing with entries.

The Ctrl+Letter alternative keys are for terminals
without special function keys.
Most of them are the same as in the <I>EMACS</I>-Editor.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Range_</H2>
A range is a rectangular sub-section of the worksheet which:
<P>
<P>
- is defined by two cells at two corners of the range
<P>
- encompasses all of the cells inside this sub-section.
<P>
Several commands act upon a range of cells.
The
<I>[Mark]</I>
key specifies a corner of the range.
There is always a marked range shown at the top of the worksheet.
The marked range is also displayed highlighted
(unless
option <I>-h</I>
was given at startup).
Inside the marked range the current cell will be not highlighted.
Before a command that acts on a range can be used,
the correct range must be marked.
<P>
A range can be named with the
<I>/Range Name</I>
command.
This name can be used in
formulas.
A valid range name consists of a starting character and
at least one more alphanumeric character or the special characters
backslash (<B>\</B>), underscore (<B>_</B>) and dollar (<B>$</B>).
When a named range is used for a cell,
the upper left cell of the range is used.
Named ranges are adjusted when moved or
after inserting or deleting columns or rows.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Menu_</H2>
With the
<I>[Menu]</I>
key,
<B>mc</B>
enters the command menu.
Within the menu there are powerful commands to alter the worksheet.
To choose a menu item move to it with the cursor-keys until
it is highlighted and press the [ENTER] key,
or press the highlighted character of the item.

<H2>Macros_</H2>
A macro is a sequence of keystrokes or commands which can
be  performed automatically, just like a program within the spreadsheet.
Unlike most spreadsheets,
macros in <B>mc</B> are stored in files instead of inside the worksheet.
A macro can be executed with the [<I>Macro</I>]-key.
The macro will continue to execute until end-of-file.
An auto-execute macro (see
option <I>-o</I>
) starts executing
immediately after the worksheet is loaded.
<P>
Every letter in the macro is simply feeded into
<B>mc</B>
as normal input.
Exceptions are
<B>&lt;tab&gt;</B>
and <B>&lt;newline&gt;</B>;
they do nothing.
All macro keys
must be enclosed in curly braces {}.
An optional repeat count can be appended.
<BR>
<B>MACRO KEYS</B>

</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
After Fixed or Science formats,
<B>mc</B>
prompts for the number of decimal places to be displayed.
The default format for all new cells is <I>General</I>,
which is a generic format.
The default format and decimal places can be changed with the
<I>-f</I>
and
<I>-d</I> options
at startup.
When a new cell is entered and the cell above
(one row higher) has a non-default format,
the new cell is auto-formatted with that format.
This helps setting up tables of data.
Cells with no contents cannot be formatted.
The cell value does not change when formatted.
Bold and Italic are not formats, but are
attributes (see below).
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Numbers_</H2>
Values can be entered in a cell simply by moving to the cell and typing in
the number.
With the
<I>[Enter]</I>
key,
<B>mc</B>
will put the text into the current cell and display its contents.
<BR>
<B>COMPLEX</B>
<BR>
Complex values are entered with &quot;i&quot; between the real and the imaginary part.
For example &quot;0i1&quot; is the representation for &quot;i&quot; = SQRT(-1).
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Text_</H2>
Text can be entered in a cell simply by moving to the cell and typing in
the text.
With the
<I>[Enter]</I>
key,
<B>mc</B>
will put the text into the current cell and display its contents.
<BR>
<B>JUSTIFICATION</B>
<BR>
Text cells can be displayed left or right justified in a cell depending on the
first character, the justification sign.
If the first character is an apostrophe (<B>'</B>)
the text will be left justified.
If it is a quotation mark (<B>&quot;</B>) right justified.
If no justification sign is specified at the start of the text,
<B>mc</B>
will add a left justification sign as default.
<BR>
<B>REPEATING</B>
<BR>
The special justification sign backslash (<B>\</B>) will
cause the following character be repeated in the whole cell.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Formulas_</H2>
Formulas are entered like
text.
<B>mc</B>
will determine whether the entered string is a legal formula or
text.
If a string starts like a formula,
<B>mc</B>
assumes a syntax error and put the cursor in the place where the error starts.
If the cell is text and not a formula, simply press
<I>[Escape]</I>
or begin the text with one of the
justification signs.
<P>
Cell names in formulas are typed in with the column followed by the row enclosed
in square brackets separated by semicolon.
Relative cell references start with a sign.
An absolute cell reference can be written without brackets or comma.
Toggle absolute cell references in formulas with relative references by pressing F4 (or $).
Named Ranges can be used directly with the rangename.
<BR>

<BR>
<B>SPECIAL</B>
<BR>
Formulas can be used recursively!
That means that in spite of copying a formula cell,
the absolute cell reference preceded by ampersand (<B>&amp;</B>) can be used.
This saves memory and, when changing the formula,
all formulas entered in this way
will change automatically, because they refer to the same
formula text string!
Think of this as a way of defining user functions in a worksheet.

<BR>
<B>STRINGS</B>
<BR>
Strings in formulas are entered enclosed in 
quotation marks (<B>&quot;</B>).
If a cell is preceded by hash (<B>#</B>) it refers to the cell string
instead of the value.
Strings can be concatenated without any operator.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Dates_</H2>
Dates can be entered as formulas like
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<H2>Operators_</H2>
An operator is a function that  is built into
<B>mc</B>
formula language.
It
usually  relates  one  operand  to  another.

<B>mc</B>
operators:

</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
In addition to these C-like operators,
also operators known from other commonly used spreadsheet programs (e.g.:
#AND#, #OR#, ...) can be used.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Precedence_</H2>
Precedence refers to  the order in  which
<B>mc</B>
executes operators.
Cell formula languages assign a level of  precedence to each operator.
Operators are  executed in the  order of their  precedence level,
from highest to lowest.
<P>
The  following table  summarizes the  precedence of
<B>mc</B>
operators.
They are listed in descending order of precedence:  those listed
higher in the table are executed before those lower in the table.
Operators  listed  on  the  same  line  have the  same  level  of
precedence, and the  implementation determines the order in which
they are executed.
If you use  two or more such operators in the
same expression, you would be wise to use parentheses to indicate
exactly the order in which you want the operators executed.

<B>mc</B>
always determines precedence in an expression by enclosing
sub-expressions  within   parentheses:  the  expression  enclosed
within the innermost parentheses is always executed first.
<BR>
<B>SIMPLY</B>
<BR>
All of the rules of basic algebra apply to expressions in <B>mc</B>.
Remember to use parentheses to indicate exactly the order in which you want
the operators executed.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Units_</H2>
<B>mc</B>
has a unique feature called automatic unit conversion.
If you use the
<I>-u</I> option
at startup, then
<B>$ARX/mcunits</B>
acts as a background process to convert units.
You can assign a unit to each constant value in a formula by placing it in curly
brackets after the constant.
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
ex. 2.3{g} -- makes this 2.3 grams.
</PRE>
</DL>
This will put the string of the unit in the cell right next to the cell with
the constant.
<B>mc</B>
keeps track of all units you use in formulas and will refuse to calculate
senseless expressions.
When adding a unit (in curly brackets) at the end of a formula,
the calculated value is converted to that unit.
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
ex. A1: value:   12.00{m}
    A2: value:    1.00{sec}
    A3: value:   12.00{mile/hour}
    A4: formula: a1/a2       = 12.00 m/sec
    A5: formula: a3+a4       = 38.84 mile/hour
    A6: formula: a5+6{pound} = ERROR  Unit conformity
    A7: formula: a5{m/min}   = 1041.87 m/min
</PRE>
</DL>
The syntax of the units is the same as in <B>mcunits</B>.
To add units to the database see the documentation of <B>mcunits</B>.
<BR>
<B>LIMITATIONS</B>
<BR>
Units are not implemented for the ^ (power) operator and for all
nonstatistical functions like SQRT!
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Piping_</H2>
<B>mc</B>
has a very advanced interface to the operating system via piping.
This offers unmatched flexibility based
upon the Unix operating system's piping mechanism.
Since the database
<B>/rdb</B>
is based upon the shell level this can be used perfectly for database
interactions like queries or updates in tables.
<P>
A cell statement with the syntax:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>cell</I>&lt;<I>command</I>
</PRE>
</DL>
is called a cell-command.
When such a cell is entered,
it will execute the command and put the command's output into
the range of cells starting with cell as the upper-left corner.
The output is read line by line into the rows of the range.
The columns, which have to be separated by
<B>&lt;tab&gt;</B>
in the output of the command,
are placed into the columns of the range.
At the end of the data a special cell value designated 'EOF' (end of file)
is placed in the cell below the data.
Therefore,
<B>/rdb</B>
commands work especially well with
<B>mc</B>
because this is exactly the format of 
<B>/rdb</B>
tables.
But also all other standard Unix commands like
<B>sed, awk, cut, ...</B>
can produce output of this format.
It is also simple to produce input-files with any standard editor,
or write own programs which can feed <B>mc</B>.
Since formulas can be used recursively with the '&amp;' operator;
you can also build flexible commands of querying or updating a database.
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
ex. B2&lt;cat expenses
</PRE>
</DL>
Puts the table
<I>expenses</I>
into the cell range B2..F5.
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
ex. B2&lt;row 'Onhand &lt; &amp;F15' &lt;inventory
</PRE>
</DL>
Select all rows in the
<I>inventory</I>
table in which
<I>Onhand</I>
is less than the value in the cell F15
into the cell range B2..G5.
<P>
A cell statement of the form:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>cell</I>&lt;&lt;<I>command</I>
</PRE>
</DL>
will act the same way but does not overwrite the data in the output range.
The data is inserted into the worksheet
by inserting a new row into the worksheet for every line in the commands output.
Existing cell contents in the first row are copied into every inserted row.
This is useful, when a formula should act on every line of the output.
<P>
A cell statement of the form:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>cell</I>&lt;!<I>command</I>
</PRE>
</DL>
will act the same way but parses the incoming cells as formulas.
This is especially useful with the <B>mcread</B> command.
This command is part of the system
and can extract the formulas
of a given range or the whole worksheet
from a <B>mc</B>-file from standard input.
It inserts
<B>&lt;tab&gt;</B>
between the formulas of the selected columns.
With this combination any
range
from a extern worksheet-file
can be easily copied to a range in the current worksheet.
For example the command:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
f9&lt;!mcread -rb3-d7 &lt;somedata.mc
</PRE>
</DL>
selects all constants/formulas from range B3.D7 in the worksheet-file
<I>somedata.mc</I>
and copies them to the range starting with cell F9
into the current worksheet.
This procedure has the advantage that the source file and range
are stored in the command-cell,
and can always be re-imported by re-editing and
re-executing the command (see below).
The disadvantage is that the attributes and formats are not imported,
but once they are set up,
they are used by the next import and keep intact.
Call
<B>mcread</B>
with the
<I>-h</I>
option to get a reference of the command.
<P>
A cell statement of the form:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>cell</I>&gt;<I>command</I>
</PRE>
</DL>
will execute the command and feed the cell range starting with cell
into the input of the command.
The cell range starts with cell in the left upper corner until it
reaches an empty cell right of the starting cell,
and until it reaches the 'EOF'-cell on the way down the worksheet.
<P>
The cell statement:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
B2&gt;cat &gt;expenses
</PRE>
</DL>
places the updated table from the worksheet back into the database.
To determine where to stop, the special 'EOF'-cell must be found.
It can be entered by placing the string &quot;EOF&quot; into the cell
below the data, as long as it was not written by a former query.
<P>
To reexecute any cell-command simply reedit it with
<I>[Edit] [Return].</I>
<BR>
<B>ERROR MESSAGES</B>
<BR>
All output to standard error of cell-commands is redirected to the
<B>mc</B>
error message line.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>mcrdb_</H2>
The shell-script <B>mcrdb</B> uses
<B>mc</B>
as a table editor for structured text-files or <B>/rdb</B>-tables.
With the command:
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
mcrdb <I>table</I>
</PRE>
</DL>
the file (or <B>/rdb</B>-table) &quot;table&quot; is locked and loaded into a worksheet.
<B>mc</B>
is called for editing the table in a much more convenient way than with
<B>ve</B>,
the <B>/rdb</B> table-editor.
The user can see more than one row simultaneously,
and all spreadsheet-power can be used to modify the data.
Inserting, copying and deleting rows or fields is very easy.
It is a good idea to examine the shell-script how it works as an
example of using the advanced integration possibilities of
<B>mc</B>
and <B>/rdb</B>.
Of course
<B>mcrdb</B>
can only work when
<B>/rdb</B>
is installed.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Linking_</H2>
The worksheet currently in memory can be linked to worksheets on disk using the 
<I>LINK</I>
function of <B>mc</B>.
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
    LINK(&quot;filename&quot;,cell)
ex. LINK(&quot;/u/tom/sample.mc&quot;,A23)
</PRE>
</DL>
Since file linking is slow, linked cells are not recalculated.
However, if you enter a cell
<BR>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
ex. LINK(&quot;/u/tom/sample.mc&quot;,A23)+A12
</PRE>
</DL>
then the link is recalculated every time because it is a formula!
To avoid this, place only the link in one cell and put a formula in an
additional cell which refers to the link-cell.
Another advantage of this way is,
that the cell in the link is not adjusted
in column or row deletes or inserts or moves of the cell in the link.
To avoid this misbehavior,
it is also possible to use named cells and build the link with the name
instead of the absolute reference.
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Mathematical functions_</H2>
The  following functions act upon the argument 'x' within

<B>[nt]roff</B>
to do the hard work of text formatting.
The marked range is piped to the shell procedure
<I>$ARX/lib/mcprint</I>
with the command
<I>/Print</I>
This procedure passes its input to
<B>nroff</B>
as the default.
<I>$ARX/lib/mcprint</I>
can be modified
to the user's needs, for example to add a standard header to every printed
worksheet or to change
<B>nroff</B>
to
<B>troff</B>
and
<B>lpr</B>
to <B>hpr</B>.
<P>
<B>[nt]roff</B>
commands can be used by putting them directly into the
left side cells of the printing range.
For example, the menu command
<I>/Worksheet Page</I>
simply adds a &quot;.bp&quot;
<I>break page</I>
command into the worksheet.

<H2>Limitations_</H2>
The date and time functions do not work with dates prior to Dec 14, 1902.
The date display format does not work with dates prior to Jan 1, 1970
and after Jan 18, 2038 due to UNIX's date limits.
<P>
Since there is a bug in cursor positioning of the COHERENT curses-library,
the lower-right position of the screen is never displayed.
<P>
The function shortcut for SUM(Range) to write only Range (mc V&lt;=3.01)
was removed from mc V4 due to parser problems with range names.
<A NAME="lbBM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Terminal_</H2>
Since this product is based on the
<B>curses</B>
library,
the program run on the console as well as on terminals.
<P>
The following table list the keys and their corresponding entries in
<I>/etc/termcap</I>
or
<I>/usr/lib/terminfo/?/*.</I>
COHERENT-3.x versions work with
<B>termcap,</B>
all others with
<B>terminfo.</B>
<P>
The table also lists the used screen attributes.
If you want color output you can change the entries to sequences
for colors colors on your terminal.
<P>
The keys and screen attributes can only work
if their correct entries are made in the terminals description,
which is identified by the environment variable
<B>TERM.</B>
