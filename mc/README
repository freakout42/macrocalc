INSTALL (system-wide)
=====================
"sudo make install" will install systemwide in /opt/arx/ after a successfull
build by simply untar'ing ./dist/arx.tar.gz into /opt. Nothing outside
/opt/arx/ will be touched in any way by the installation. Removing mc is
simply done by a recursive "rm -r /opt/arx". For convenience /opt/arx/bin
should be added to the PATH in a system appropriate manner. mc can also be
run by its alias "321" if "mc" is used for another program. If /opt/arx is
not appropriate for the admin the arx-directory can be moved or renamed
anywhere. In this case an environment-variable ARX must be exported with
the full path of the moved directory. MANPATH should also get the
man-directory. Here is an example for Linux/bash:

  # /etc/profile.d/arx.sh
  ARX=/opt/arx
  export ARX
  PATH=$PATH:$ARX/bin
  MANPATH=$MANPATH:$ARX/man
