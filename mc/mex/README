MEX is a tiny, simple, and portable Emacs-like screen Editor.
It has a help screen and every feature an editor MUST have.
It has no additional features, therefore it is fast and tiny.
Ideal for editing a three line shell- or perl-script or a small
config file - the best alternative for all vi-haters. The 7.1
version can handle utf8-coded files. Runs on terminal and in
ssh and telnet sessions as well as in the windows console.
