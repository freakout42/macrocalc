.B mc
is an interactive, macro-programmable spreadsheet calculator.
.B mc
has no graphic features, but therefore it can run also on terminals.
It uses a convenient,
well-known user interface and has some special features especially
interesting in the
.B UNIX
environment.
It is the only spreadsheet that can handle units in calculations -
so 1m + 1km = 1001m.
