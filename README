mc - MacroCALC is a Lotus 1-2-3 compatible character based spreadsheet that
supports 100000 rows, 700 columns, 40 functions, display formats, file
linking, macro programming, pipes and user definable functions.

MacroCALC is the only spreadsheet that manages units: 1 mile + 1 km = 1.62
miles; 1 km / 1 hour * 30 sec = 8.33 m. This can be seen as a physics engine.
On the way is also the support of complex numbers with complex arithmetic
and functions. So sqrt(-1) = i (coming soon).

It's git-maintained, lint-clean ANSI-C source is based on yacc, lex and
[n]curses. It runs on every terminal or emulation that has a correct
terminfo-entry. The user-interface is very convenient and well-known by 1-2-3
users. Function- and cursor-keys and extended video attributes are supported.

BUILD (and run)
===============
Building mc needs an ANSI-C compiler with curses-lib, lex and yacc (ncurses,
flex and bison for GNU-systems). Run "./configure" followed by "make". All
programs are build into ./dist/arx and can run without sudo-installation
directly from the build-driectory. To start the spreadsheet simply:

  dist/arx/bin/321

INSTALL (system-wide)
=====================
"sudo make install" installs mc systemwide in /opt/arx/. Nothing outside
/opt/arx/ will be touched in any way by the installation. Removing mc is
simply done by a recursive "rm -r /opt/arx". For convenience /opt/arx/bin
should be added to the PATH in a system appropriate manner. After that
"321" starts the spreadsheet.

GETTING STARTED
===============
Navigate through the sheet with the cursor-keys. The dot (.) marks the
beginning and end of a range, which can be copied or manipulated with the
menu by the slash (/). The apostrophe (') starts a text-cell, any other
key a number or formula. Open "mc" and type (<dn> is cursor-down):
  . ' h e l l o <dn>  
you have marked A1 as range starting point and set A1 to text "hello".
Lets enter some numbers and a formula by typing:
  1 <dn> 2 <dn> . a 2 + a 3 $ <dn>  
you have now A2=1 A3=2 A4=3 and A1..A4 as range. Now navigate to B1 and:
  / c <dn> 3 <dn> 4 <dn>
you have copied the range A1..A4 to B1..B4 and B2=3 B3=4 and B4=5.
Why is B3=5 and not 3 or 7? Because you typed $ after a3 this makes it
a relative cell reference and refers to B3 in the copied formula.
